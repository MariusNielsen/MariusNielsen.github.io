## Math questions:
- In the $Q$-shaped category is it true that perfect objects and compact objects coincide?
- For $T$ a $tt$-category, and $p\in \mathrm{Spc}(T)$ is it true that $\mathrm{End}(1)_p=\mathrm{End}(1_p)$?
- For $T$ a $tt$-category, is it true that the stalks of $\mathcal{O}$ is given by $T/p$?
- Can we explicitly compute the comparison map? Is it a lift along $\pi_0$ of Balmer's comparison? This is my life
- Explore what module $\mathrm{Mod}\to \mathrm{CAlg}$ cocartesian fibration gives us in case of $tt$-categories
- Explore how Kan extended the presheaf I wrote down is. (Is it right Kan extended from values on complements of $\mathrm{supp}(x)$?). Look at 2.2.1.1 in HA.
- Compute the stalks of tt-sheaf
- Compute the values of distinguished opens on tt-sheaf.test
