## Math questions:
- In the $Q$-shaped category is it true that perfect objects and compact objects coincide?
- For $T$ a $tt$-category, and $p\in \mathrm{Spc}(T)$ is it true that $\mathrm{End}(1)_p=\mathrm{End}(1_{p}}$?
- For $T$ a $tt$-category, is it true that the stalks of $\mathcal{O}$ is given by $T/p$?
- Can we explicitly compute the comparison map? Is it a lift along $\pi_0$ of Balmer's comparison?
