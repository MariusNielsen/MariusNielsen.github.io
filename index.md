# Who am I

I am a forth-year PhD-student at the math department at NTNU in Trondheim under supervision of Drew Heard. I am broadly interested in stable homotopy theory, tensor triangulated geometry and their relationship with spectral algebraic geometry and synthetic spectra.

Please feel free to contact me on marius.v.b.nielsen (at) ntnu (dot) no

# Papers
- _[The presentable stable envelope of an exact category](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02598)_. Joint with [Christoph Winges](https://homepages.uni-regensburg.de/~wic42659/)

# Expository writing

- _[Chromatic homotopy theory, from the perspective of formal groups ](/FormalGroups.pdf)_. Written notes I did as part of a PhD level seminar course I did at NTNU spring 2023. These notes acted as talking points for the seminar I gave as my exam.
