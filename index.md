# Who am I

I am a first-year PhD-student at the math department at NTNU in Trondheim under supervision of Drew Heard. My main interests are (higher) category theory, stable homotopy theory and homological algebra.

Please feel free to contact me on marius.v.b.nielsen (at) ntnu (dot) no

# Writing

- _[Chromatic homotopy theory, from the perspective of formal groups ](/FormalGroups.pdf)_. Written notes I did as part of a PhD level seminar course I did at NTNU spring 2023. These notes acted as talking points for the seminar I gave as my exam. 
- _[The Q-shaped Derived Category](/MastersThesisMain.pdf)_. My masters thesis supervised by [Henrik Holm](http://web.math.ku.dk/~holm/index.html) at the University of Copenhagen in block 3 and 4 2021/2022.
- _[Idempotent algebras and stable recollement](/IdempotentAlgebrasAndRecollement.pdf)_. Notes from a talk I gave in "_Topics In Algebraic Topology_" at the University of Copenhagen in block 2 2021/2022.
- _[Monadicity of the Bousfield-Kuhn functor](/main-monadicity-of-BK.pdf)_. Notes from a talk I gave in "_Topics In Algebraic Topology_" at the University of Copenhagen in block 2 2020/2021.
- _[Stable infinity-categories](/stableinfinitycatsMain.pdf)_. Notes from a talk I gave in "_Topics In Algebraic Topology_" at the University of Copenhagen in block 2 2020/2021.
- _[On Homotopy Colimits](/BscMain.pdf)_. My Bachelors thesis supervised by [Piotr PstrÄ…gowski](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~piotr/) at the University of Copenhagen in block 3 and 4 2019/2020.
- _[Tannaka Duality](/TannakaDualityMain.pdf)_. Project out of course scope supervised by Thomas Wassermann at the University of Copenhagen in block 3 and 4 2018/2019.
